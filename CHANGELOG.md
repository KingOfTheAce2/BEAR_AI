  - New: `config.yaml` format
  - Migration: Run `python -m bear_ai migrate-config` to auto-convert

- **Breaking Change**: PII API changes
  - Old: `pii.scrub(text)`
  - New: `pii.Policy().scrub(text)`
  - Migration: Update import statements and instantiate Policy class

- **New Features**: Hardware detection now automatic
  - No manual configuration needed
  - Use `--suggest` flag to see recommended models

## Performance Improvements by Version

| Version | CPU Performance | Memory Usage | Startup Time | Model Loading |
|---------|----------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1.0.0   | +40% faster    | -20% usage   | -50% time    | +60% faster   |
| 0.9.0   | +25% faster    | -10% usage   | -30% time    | +30% faster   |

## Known Issues

### Version 1.0.0
- GPU acceleration on AMD cards experimental
- macOS ARM64 builds require manual compilation
- Large models (70B+) may exceed memory on 16GB systems

### Workarounds
- Use CPU mode for AMD GPUs until OpenCL support added
- macOS users can use Rosetta 2 until native ARM builds available
- Consider model quantization (Q4/Q5) for memory-constrained systems
