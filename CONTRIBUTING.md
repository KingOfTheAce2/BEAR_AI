# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Reporting Bugs
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one.
- Include your system specs and error logs; it helps a ton.

## Suggesting Enhancements
- Open a new issue with a clear title and description.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful.
- Include mockups or examples if you can.

## Your First Code Contribution
Choose Your Adventure:

- Frontend UI and logic → `web-app/`
- Shared API declarations → `core/`
- Backend system integration → `src-tauri/`
- Business logic features → `extensions/`
- Dedicated backend handler → `src-tauri/plugins/`

The Process:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. Make your changes (and write tests!).
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-name`).
6. Open a new Pull Request against the `dev` branch.

## Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Be descriptive but concise.
- Reference issues when applicable.
