### 5. NLP Entity Recognition (Line 481)
- **Implementation**: Added `extract_entities_with_nlp()` method with multiple sub-methods
- **Features**:
  - Organization name extraction (Inc, LLC, Corp, etc.)
  - Person name extraction with false positive filtering
  - Location extraction (City, State format)
  - Contract party identification
  - Enhanced pattern matching for legal entities

### 6. LLM-based Entity Extraction (Line 627)
- **Implementation**: Complete `extract_entities_with_llm()` method
- **Features**:
  - Integration with local LLM manager
  - Structured prompts for entity extraction
  - JSON response parsing
  - Confidence scoring for LLM-extracted entities
  - Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 7. Key Term Extraction (Line 825)
- **Implementation**: Full TF-IDF-like algorithm implementation
- **Features**:
  - Text tokenization with built-in stemming
  - Term frequency calculation
  - Stop word filtering (built-in English stop words)
  - Legal term boosting
  - Term categorization (Legal, Financial, Technical, Temporal, Geographic, Parties)
  - Importance scoring algorithm

### 8. Sentiment Analysis (Line 874)
- **Implementation**: Lexicon-based sentiment analysis
- **Features**:
  - Positive/negative word classification
  - Overall sentiment scoring (-1.0 to 1.0)
  - Confidence measurement
  - Emotional indicators analysis (aggression, cooperation, uncertainty, risk)
  - Legal document-specific word lists

### 9. Compliance Checking (Line 885)
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive compliance rules engine
- **Features**:
  - **GDPR Compliance**: Personal data processing, consent requirements, data retention
  - **Contract Law**: Governing law clauses, dispute resolution, force majeure
  - **Employment Law**: At-will employment, equal opportunity statements
  - **Financial Compliance**: Payment terms clarity, interest rate compliance
  - **Accessibility Compliance**: ADA requirements for digital services
  - Risk-based priority assignment

## Dependencies Added

### Cargo.toml Updates
```toml
# Language detection and NLP
whatlang = "0.16"        # Language detection
lopdf = "0.32"           # PDF parsing
pdf-extract = "0.7"      # PDF text extraction
```

### Built-in Implementations
