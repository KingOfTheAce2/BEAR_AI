# BEAR AI Development Plan

BEAR AI (Bridge for Expertise, Audit and Research) aims to deliver a privacy-first, local-only AI assistant for legal and professional workflows. This plan outlines the high-level steps for turning the repository into a full Windows executable with strong security and PII protections.

## 1. Architecture & Core Features
- Modular desktop application with local large language model (LLM) support.
- Document ingestion and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for legal documents.
- Extensible plugin system for exporting chats and integrating external tools.

## 2. Technology Stack & Build Targets
- Language: Python for core logic with an Electron or Tauri wrapper for GUI.
- Model runtime: llama.cpp or similar framework for running GGUF models locally.
- Build pipeline: use PyInstaller or `npm run build`/`tauri build` to produce a Windows `.exe`.

## 3. Security & Privacy
- Run entirely offline; all network activity disabled by default.
- Mandatory logging and audit trails to capture actions without exposing data.
- Implement role-based access controls for multi-user environments.
- Regular dependency scanning and static analysis.

## 4. NVIDIA GPU & PII Removal
- Integrate NVIDIA GPU acceleration via CUDA for model inference.
- Use libraries such as NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails or custom CUDA kernels for real-time PII detection.
- Preprocess documents with anonymization tools (e.g., Presidio) before they reach the model.

## 5. Development Workflow
- Adopt git-based feature branching with pull requests and automated tests.
- Continuous integration pipeline running linting, unit tests, and binary build checks.
- Versioned releases with signed binaries for trust.

## 6. Next Steps
1. Define minimal viable product requirements.
2. Prototype document chat and PII scrubbing modules.
3. Establish CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
4. Package initial Windows build.

This plan will evolve as the project progresses and new requirements emerge.
