## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS

### Option 1: Deploy WITHOUT Certificate (READY NOW!)
```powershell
# Build and deploy unsigned version
.\scripts\deploy-unsigned.ps1

# Creates:
# - Unsigned installer (.exe)
# - Installation guide for users
# - Helper scripts for easier installation
```

**Pros:**
- Can deploy immediately
- No certificate cost ($0)
- Fully functional application

**Cons:**

- Need to click "Run anyway"
- Some antivirus may flag initially

### Option 2: Deploy WITH Certificate (WHEN READY)
```powershell
# Full production deployment
.\scripts\deploy-production.ps1

# Requires:
# - Code signing certificate ($200-600/year)
# - Certificate installation
# - Environment variables configured
```

**Pros:**
- No security warnings
- Professional appearance
- Better user trust

**Cons:**
- Certificate cost
- Setup time required
