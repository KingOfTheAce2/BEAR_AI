if (error.recoveryActions.length > 0) {
  await error.recoveryActions[0].action();
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Built-in performance tracking
const duration = await measureAsyncPerformance('api-call', async () => {
  return await apiClient.post('/legal/analyze', document);
});
```

### Component Standardization

// Consistent component patterns
const OptimizedButton = ComponentFactory.createButton(BaseButton, {
  name: 'LegalActionButton',
  category: 'ui',
  enableMetrics: true
});
```
