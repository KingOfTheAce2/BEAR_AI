# Installation and Model Selection Recommendations

## Smoother Installation
- Package Python and C++ dependencies in a single installer or container to avoid manual setup.
- Use packaging tools such as PyInstaller or Docker so users can install everything in one step.
- Provide a guided setup script or GUI-based installer that automatically checks system requirements and downloads dependencies.

## Easier Model Selection
- Detect user hardware (CPU, GPU, RAM) and offer a curated list of popular models that fit their system.
- Provide an advanced search interface connected to Hugging Face for browsing all available models.
- Include clear descriptions and performance notes so non-technical users know the expected hardware demands.

### Quick CLI Suggestion

```powershell
python -m bear_ai --suggest
```

Displays curated models that are likely to run on your current machine.
