- Use Q4 quantization instead of Q8
- Check "Hardware Info" for recommendations
```

**‚ùå Model Gives Poor Quality Responses**
```
CAUSES:
- Model too small for complex tasks
- Over-quantization (Q4 when Q8 needed)
- Incorrect model for task type

SOLUTIONS:
- Try larger model if hardware allows
- Use higher quantization (Q8 or F16)
- Select model recommended for your use case
- Check model descriptions and capabilities
```

**‚ùå Out of Memory Errors**
```
CAUSES:
