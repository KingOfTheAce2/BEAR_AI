## Performance Questions

### Why is BEAR AI slow on my computer?

**Performance Optimization:**

1. **Check System Requirements**
   ```
   Minimum: 8GB RAM, x64 processor with AVX2
   Recommended: 16GB+ RAM, modern multi-core CPU
   ```

2. **Model Selection**
   ```
   Large models (13B+) require more memory
   Try smaller models (3B-7B) for better performance
   Use GPU acceleration if available
   ```

3. **Memory Management**
   ```
   Close unnecessary applications
   Monitor memory usage in BEAR AI status bar
   Enable automatic memory optimization
   ```

4. **Storage Performance**
   ```
   Use SSD for model storage
   Ensure adequate free space (10GB+)
   Avoid network-mounted storage
   ```

### How can I improve document processing speed?

**Optimization Tips:**

1. **Hardware Optimization**
   ```
   Enable GPU acceleration in settings
   Increase system RAM if possible
   Use fast SSD storage
   ```

2. **Processing Settings**
   ```
   Process documents in smaller batches
   Reduce analysis complexity for initial review
   Use streaming mode for real-time feedback
   ```

3. **Model Configuration**
   ```
   Select appropriate model size for your hardware
   Enable model caching for frequently used models
   Use quantized models for better performance
   ```

### GPU acceleration isn't working

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. **NVIDIA GPUs**
   ```
   Install latest NVIDIA drivers
   Install CUDA Toolkit 11.8 or 12.x
   Verify GPU appears in Device Manager
   Check GPU compatibility (GTX 1060+ recommended)
   ```

2. **AMD GPUs (Linux only)**
   ```
   Install ROCm drivers
   Verify ROCm installation: rocm-smi
   Check GPU compatibility with ROCm
   ```

3. **Apple Silicon**
   ```
