# BEAR AI Legal Assistant - Installation Instructions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning
This application is not digitally signed. You may see security warnings during installation.

## Installation Steps:

### For Windows 10/11:

1. **Download the installer** (BEAR_AI_Setup.exe)

2. **When you see "Windows protected your PC":**
   - Click "More info"
   - Click "Run anyway"

3. **If Windows Defender blocks the file:**
   - Open Windows Security
   - Go to "Virus & threat protection"
   - Click "Protection history"
   - Find BEAR AI and click "Actions" ‚Üí "Allow"

4. **During installation:**
   - You may see "Unknown Publisher" - this is normal
   - Click "Yes" to continue

## Why These Warnings?
- The app is not digitally signed (certificates cost $200-600/year)
- The app is safe but Windows doesn't recognize it
- After first installation, warnings will be reduced

## Verify Application Integrity
SHA256 Checksum: $(Get-FileHash "$distPath\*.exe" -Algorithm SHA256 | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty Hash)

## Support
If you have issues, please contact: support@bear-ai.com

## Making Installation Smoother
To avoid warnings in the future, we need to:
1. Purchase a code signing certificate
2. Get enough users to build reputation with Windows SmartScreen

Thank you for your patience during our initial release!
