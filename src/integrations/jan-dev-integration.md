# Jan-Dev Integration into BEAR AI Framework

## Integration Overview

This document outlines the integration of jan-dev capabilities into the BEAR AI framework, focusing on local LLM integration, extension system, build system migration, and state management.

## Integration Components

### 1. Local LLM Integration
- Port llamacpp-extension patterns to BEAR AI
- Implement model management and switching
- Memory optimization for multi-agent scenarios

### 2. Extension System Integration
- Create BEAR AI plugin architecture based on jan-dev extensions
- Legal document processing extensions
- Agent coordination extensions

### 3. Build System Migration
- Integrate Vite + Tauri build system
- Configure TypeScript and testing frameworks
- Setup cross-platform packaging

### 4. State Management Integration
- Implement Zustand-based state management
- Real-time agent coordination
- Event-driven architecture

## Implementation Status

- [x] Analysis of jan-dev codebase patterns
- [x] BEAR AI structure analysis
- [ ] Local LLM integration implementation
- [ ] Extension system architecture
- [ ] Build system configuration
- [ ] State management implementation

## Next Steps

1. Implement local LLM management system
2. Create plugin architecture
3. Configure build system
4. Implement state management
5. Create legal document processing extensions
